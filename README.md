Creating a landing page.

This page will be a monthly subscription page.

This is a single, responsive component (not an entire landing page)

11/17/2020 update:
Today I created a simple form in my html file that I will customize in my css file.
I also added a button to the form and will be customizing that as well.

Next goal is to get the layout of the page right. I need everything to align perfectly and click together.
I was thinking grid would be the best option, but I am now thinking I should probably use flexbox, as it is
easier for me to work with, and I think this will make the page work bettetr as I add responsive elements.

-- Will add checkbox for subscription choice, rather than a drop down menu, unless the checkbox looks messy.
